/*

  Text-wraps inside flex items by default. And the text is below the image because <div> is a block element.

  text-align is placed inside body as all text and inline items are centered within their containers.

  each info description was put inside its own div container so that they act as a single flex item that can be 
  separated with the gap of 52 pixels.
  The items are also centered within the container of 'plants'. This is not done by space-evenly because
  this requires centering of these items horizontally wheras space-evenly gives equal spaces in all areas.

  Also observe how all items in the HTML share the .info class because they all require the same behavior.
  Class is useful to do this and can quickly be applied to items.
